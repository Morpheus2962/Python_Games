# Flappy Bird:
  
  
This is my first time making a game in Python. 

I have tried to use Pygame library to make this game. I have also used external Images in this game.

 ## Usage

**Dependencies**

The only Python dependencies not in the standard library are:

  * pygame
  



**Training**

To use this you need to install required libraries.

To install pygame libraries run:

      $ pip install pygame    

To play the game run :

      $ python flappy.py
